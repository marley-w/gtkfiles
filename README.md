# gtkfiles

This is a filemanager made by me, for me. 

The most humble filemanager :)

(I only made this because **I can not be fucked to bring in desktop-common depedancies** with all the gtk file managers)

better looking interface is a given but I have to implement everything first because my coding skills are a 3/10


**Done in a day or 2** drag/drop, dynamic open-with

**Done as soon as I figure it out** file-roller, progress bars, polkit

**FUCK IM NOT AN ARTIST** designing is difficult for me, thats why theres no tree on the left hand side. I'm not sure what I want.
