# gtkfiles

This is a filemanager made by me, for me. 

The most humble filemanager :)

(I only made this because **I can not be fucked to bring in desktop-common depedancies** with all the gtk file managers)

better looking interface is a given but I have to implement everything first because my coding skills are a 3/10


**Done later than expected** drag/drop, dynamic open-with, progress bars, polkit

Very slightly in a rewriting process
