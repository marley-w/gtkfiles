# hyprfiles

This is a filemanager made by me, for me. You can use it and it should work. Just remember that this menu is spesifically taliored towards my current needs. (my needs spesifically being on the 'open-with' section where i spesifcally use zen-browser nvim kitty wine and steam)

The most simple filemanager :)

(I only made this because I can not be fucked to bring in desktop-common depedancies with all the gtk file managers)
