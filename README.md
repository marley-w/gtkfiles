# gtkfiles

This is a filemanager made by me, for me. You can use it and it should work. Just remember that this menu is taliored towards my current needs. (my needs being on the 'open-with' section where i spesifcally use zen-browser nvim kitty wine and steam)

The most simple filemanager :)

(I only made this because **I can not be fucked to bring in desktop-common depedancies** with all the gtk file managers)

some things I am working towards are proper file-roller support, dragging to outside apps, proper permissions support

better looking interface is a given but I have to implement everything first because my coding skills are a 3/10
